### Installation
Download the repository as a `.zip` file and then extract it, or clone it using the command
``` 
git clone https://github.com/ys1998/WebThwart.git
```
Change permissions of the `block.sh` file :
```
cd WebThwart/
chmod 755 block.sh
```
The `block.sh` script can be used as such by invoking it with `./block.sh`. For using it as a normal terminal command, follow these steps :
```
sudo cp block.sh /usr/bin/
```
The script can now be invoked with `block` only.

### Usage
The script can be currently used in the following manner :
* Display help menu
``` 
block [-h OR --help]
```
* Block specified websites 
```
block [domain_names of website(s) separated by <SPACE>]
```
* Block domain names present in a file (one per line)
```
block [-f OR --file] <file_name>
```
* Unblock specified domain names
```
block [-u OR --unblock] [domain_names separated by <SPACE>]
```
* List all reserved/blocked domain names
```
